# Inventory Management System - Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the Inventory Management System, a comprehensive ASP.NET Core web application designed to manage products, warehouses, suppliers, and shipments with automatic inventory tracking.

## Completed Components

### 1. Entity Models ✅

- **Product.cs**: Complete with validation attributes (Name, Description, UnitPrice, Category, SKU)
- **Warehouse.cs**: Complete with validation attributes (Name, Location, StorageCapacity)
- **Supplier.cs**: Complete with validation attributes (CompanyName, ContactEmail, ContactPhone, Address)
- **ProductWarehouse.cs**: Junction table for managing product-warehouse relationships with quantities
- **Shipment.cs**: Complete with validation attributes and automatic total cost calculation
- **ErrorViewModel.cs**: For handling application errors

### 2. Data Access Layer ✅

- **InventoryContext.cs**: Complete DbContext with:
  - All DbSet properties for entities
  - Relationship configurations in OnModelCreating
  - Data seeding with sample data
  - Proper foreign key constraints and indexes
  - Cascade delete behaviors configured appropriately

### 3. Controllers ✅

- **HomeController.cs**: Basic home page and error handling
- **ProductsController.cs**: Full CRUD operations for products
- **WarehousesController.cs**: Full CRUD operations for warehouses
- **SuppliersController.cs**: Full CRUD operations for suppliers
- **ShipmentsController.cs**: Full CRUD operations with automatic inventory updates

### 4. Views ✅

- **Layout**: Responsive navigation with Bootstrap
- **Home**: Welcome page with system overview and navigation cards
- **Products**: Index, Create views with proper validation
- **Warehouses**: Index view with CRUD operations
- **Suppliers**: Index view with CRUD operations
- **Shipments**: Index view with CRUD operations
- **Shared**: Error handling and validation scripts

### 5. Configuration ✅

- **Program.cs**: Complete ASP.NET Core configuration with Entity Framework
- **appsettings.json**: Database connection strings and logging configuration
- **Project file**: All necessary NuGet packages included

## Database Schema Implementation

### Entity Relationships

- **Products ↔ Warehouses**: Many-to-many through ProductWarehouse junction table
- **Suppliers → Shipments**: One-to-many relationship
- **Products → Shipments**: One-to-many relationship
- **Warehouses → Shipments**: One-to-many relationship

### Constraints Implemented

- Unique identifiers for all entities
- Non-negative numbers for quantities, prices, and storage capacities
- Valid formats for email, phone, and dates
- Automatic TotalCost calculation in Shipments (Quantity × UnitPrice)
- Unique constraints on SKU and email addresses

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Inventory Management

- When shipments are created, inventory is automatically updated
- ProductWarehouse junction table tracks stock quantities per warehouse
- LastUpdated timestamp tracks when inventory was last modified

### 2. Comprehensive Validation

- Client-side validation using jQuery Validation
- Server-side validation using ModelState
- Data annotations for field constraints
- Business logic validation (e.g., positive quantities, price ranges)

### 3. Sample Data

- Pre-seeded with realistic sample data
- Products: Laptop, Smartphone, Desk Chair
- Warehouses: Main Warehouse, East Coast Hub, West Coast Hub
- Suppliers: Tech Supplies Inc., Office Furniture Co., Global Electronics
- Sample shipments and inventory records

## Technical Implementation Details

### Framework & Libraries

- **.NET 8.0**: Latest stable version
- **Entity Framework Core 8.0**: ORM with SQLite provider
- **ASP.NET Core MVC**: Web framework
- **Bootstrap**: Responsive UI framework
- **jQuery**: JavaScript library for validation and DOM manipulation

### Database

- **SQLite**: Lightweight, serverless database
- **Automatic creation**: Database created on first run
- **Migrations ready**: EF Core migrations can be added for production

### Security Features

- Anti-forgery tokens on all forms
- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper model binding with validation
